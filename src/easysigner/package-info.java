/**
 * This package contains a library for executing cryptographic signatures in an easy way. Besides stateless signature
 * schemes like RSA or ECDSA it also supports stateful schemes like XMSS and XMSSMT. For those schemes, it handles the 
 * state of the private key by automatically updating and storing the key whenever a signature or a set of signatures
 * is executed.
